## Yelp Review Sentiment Analysis 

In this project The Black Pearl, a new fictional resort casino, plans to open up a location right on the Las Vegas Strip. As they continue to plan out the design and amenities for their hotel, they want to take a closer look at what the public is saying about their soon to be rivals in the area. They want to understand what topics are correlated with good and bad reviews, and to be able to classify sentiment of their own reviews on any platform to track their performance. 

This project analyzes the Yelp reviews of the current resort casinos on th Las Vegas Strip, gains insight into what topics are most important in positive and negative reviews, and delivers a model to classify positive or negative sentiment based solely on the text of the review.

The data is taken from Yelp's public dataset which is available on their website (https://www.yelp.com/dataset).

A final report and slide deck are provided to detail the scope of the project, its key findings, and recommendations. The code behind the analysis can be found in the following IPython Notebooks:
