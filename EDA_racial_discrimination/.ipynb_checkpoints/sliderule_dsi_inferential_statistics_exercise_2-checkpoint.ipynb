    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "### Exercises\n",
    "You will perform a statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes.\n",

    "Answer the following questions **in this notebook below and submit to your Github account**. \n",

    "   1. What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?\n",

    "   4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.\n",
    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "In this study we found that race does have a significant impact on the number of interview requests received in the US labor market. 4,870 resumes and interview request results were collected, and a total number of 392 candidates out of the sample received requests for interviews. 235 contained white sounding names and 157 contained black sounding names. To determine if race played a signficant role in the number of requests, we conducted a hypothesis test assuming that the average number of resumes with white sounding names and black sounding names had the same callback success rate. Conducting this test, we found that the probability of getting our observed difference in callback successes was almost zero percent assuming average callback success was equal between white and black sounding names. This result allowed us to reject the null hypothesis, and determine the difference between white sounding name and black sounding name callback success was statistically significant."

    "Our testing proved that race/name was a significant factor in callback success, but that is the extent of what was studied. There are other factors that can potentially contribute to callback success given in the data. Years of experience, education, and if they had served in military or not are a few examples. To truly test which factor is the most important, we would have to test all the possible factors in the data, and compare their impacts on callback success. This would help determine which factor had the highest impact overall."
